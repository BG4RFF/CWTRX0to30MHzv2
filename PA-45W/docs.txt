Note:
-The following data to test in person, these data sheet is in a large heat sink can withstand 200W above measured, there is not enough cooling capacity, please do not limit, it's not safe.
-The upgrade board test data,so it can be used for all HF Channel,
-In 3 to 5 MHz this period, because of the low frequency, small inductance, lead to the gain has a certain loss, the output power is lower than 7 MHz this point.
